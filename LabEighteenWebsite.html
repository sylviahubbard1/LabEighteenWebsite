                </a> Sylvia Hubbard knew she’d wanted to be a writer of romance long before she knew there were black writers in the world. Weaving stories magically as a summer past time to writing stories to get through the humdrum of school, she was able to create something from nothing.
                Today, she has independently published over thirty books, is the founder of Motown Writers Network, CEO of HubBooks Literary Services, runs over five blogs on a variety of subjects, host and produces The Michigan Literary Network Radio Show and is a happily divorced mother of three children in Detroit, Michigan.

                “I’m no superwoman,” she states with a smile that seems infinite on her lips. “I’m just being an asset in the world instead of a liability.”
                Considered an addicted blogger by HoneyTechblog.com, nominated and recognized for her literary work in the Metro Detroit area, referred to as “A Literary Diva” by Detroit City Council and donned “Cliffhanger Queen” by her readers, she finds solace in speaking and educating on a variety of topics.
            </p>
            <p>

                Her subjects range from Single Parenting, Blogging, E-Books, Publishing (all aspects i.e.: writing, publishing, marketing & promoting online & offline), and personal triumphs with inspiration mixed in.
                Never a disappointment, Sylvia Hubbard, has spoken in front of thousands all over the United States and Canada.
